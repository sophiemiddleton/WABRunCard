* FF op1 = Elastic WABs off the nucleus, with form factor = 1
* FF op2 = Elastic WABs off the nucleus, with a simple elastic-only form factor
* FF op3 = Elastic WABs off a single proton, with form factor=1
* FF op4 = Elastic WABs off a single proton, with proton elastic form factor. Need to use the proton dipole form factor.
* FF op5 = DIS-like cross-section
